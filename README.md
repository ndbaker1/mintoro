<p align="center">hacks to set up a virtual second monitor<br/>(just an anagram of monitor)</p>

## ‚ö° Usage

1. Add a Virtual Display / Monitor to the host device (depends on OS).
2. Visit the [site](https://ndbaker1.github.io/mintoro/) on the host and press the button that says `Host` .
3. An ID will be displayed; open the same [site](https://ndbaker1.github.io/mintoro/) on another device and enter in the ID.
4. On the host device, you will be asked to share an application/screen. Select the screen of the virtual display configured in step (1).
5. Fullscreen the video feed on the second device and use it as extra screen real estate!

## ü§î Motivation

Sometimes you need an extra monitor but all you have are extra devices.  
It sure would be nice if you could just use any device with a web browser as a second monitor...
